**Project ATHENA**

Introducing the Automated Task Handling with Enhancement Neural AI.
made by Elliot Waigh

This lies under the banner, and the flagship project of ATHENA Technologies, the technology subset of Impulse Social. 

This is based on the open source chat bot and task automation framework I developed. Loosely inspired by the Microsoft Bot Framework.

This framework works on a similiarty score with Context-Recognition and Entity Extraction. Context can be as convoluted and expandable as possible, simulating a real conversation with a person, without relying on a NLP program like BERT or the GPT API. 

This will be ever evolving as a private project with the goal of automating most of my business operations, as well as parts of my life.

When new systems and mechanics are developed, they will be implemented into the open source framework.

This being a private project is due to the sensitive data that will be stored within this automation project.
