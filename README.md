**Project ATHENA**

Introducing the Adaptive Task Handling and Execution Neural Agent. 
made by Elliot Waigh

ATHENA is a modular, voice-enabled automation framework designed for local or cloud execution.  It integrates speech recognition (Vosk), intent recognition (TF-IDF hybrid context engine), and modular tool interfaces.

ATHENA uses a multi-stage processing pipeline:
1.Intent Recognition – TF-IDF + Entity Extraction hybrid model
2. Context Manager – Handles parameter collection & task continuation
3. Tool Invocation – Executes dynamically registered tools (e.g., lights, calendar, Spotify)

This will be ever evolving as a private project with the goal of automating most of my daily life operations.

When new systems and mechanics are developed, they will be implemented into the open source framework.

This being a private project, not meant for mass implementation is due to the sensitive data that will be stored within this automation project.
